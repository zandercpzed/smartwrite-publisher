# CR-4-292825863-50: THE COLLECTOR

## My Sister's Inventory

_Statement from Marcus Webb, transcribed from Bureau interview. Subject's claims regarding "Emily Webb" cannot be verified through any existing records._

---

It started with small things.

Emily always lost pens. She'd buy a pack of twelve and they'd vanish within a month. We joked about it—"Emily's pen poltergeist," we called it. Then her favorite coffee mug disappeared. Then her gym membership card. Then the spare key she kept under the mat.

Normal stuff. The kind of things everyone misplaces.

Then her grandmother's ring went missing.

She never took that ring off. Not once in fifteen years. She woke up one morning and it was gone. Not on the nightstand, not in the sheets, not anywhere. She tore her apartment apart. Called the police. They found nothing.

That's when she started keeping track. A spreadsheet of everything she owned, updated weekly. She noticed patterns. Small items first, things she wouldn't miss. Then bigger things. Sentimental things.

A photo of our parents from their wedding. A ticket stub from the first concert she ever attended. Her degree certificate, the one she'd framed and hung over her desk.

The list kept growing.

I saw him once. Outside her building, just a man with a leather bag, completely unremarkable. I couldn't describe his face if you paid me. But I watched him watching her window, and I knew—in my gut, without evidence or reason—that he was counting.

She started giving things away. Not selling, giving. She gave her best friend our mother's necklace. She gave me her journals—twelve years of her life, handwritten. She gave our father her baby photos.

"Just in case," she said. She didn't know in case of what, but she was scared.

The last thing he took was a drawing I made her when I was six. A crayon picture of our family, four stick figures holding hands. She'd kept it in a safe deposit box. I don't know how he got it.

And then she was gone.

Not dead. Gone. Never existed. My parents have two children in their memories: me and an empty space. The family photos show a gap where someone should be standing. Her apartment belongs to a woman who's lived there for years and has no idea who Emily Webb is.

Nobody remembers her. Nobody except me.

I have her journals. I've shown them to the Bureau. They can't verify that the handwriting belongs to anyone who exists. But I know my sister's handwriting. I know her voice on every page.

I know she was real.

### DR. HELENA VANCE
_Bureau Documentation Division, Erasure Specialist._

The Collector is one of our most unsettling manifestations because we can never prove it has acted. Its victims don't die—they never existed. Evidence of their lives disappears. Memories adjust. Only witnesses to the collection process retain any knowledge of the erased individual.

We have seven confirmed cases where a Collector witness has provided testimony. In each case, the victim followed a similar pattern: escalating loss of personal items, growing awareness that the losses were not random, attempts to distribute possessions among others, and eventual complete erasure.

The items The Collector takes appear to be defining objects—things that constitute the victim's identity. A wedding ring. A childhood keepsake. Documents. Photographs. The specific items vary by individual, as if The Collector knows which objects anchor each person to existence.

Mr. Webb's sister apparently attempted the recommended countermeasure: distributing treasured possessions among loved ones. The theory is that items held by others are harder to collect. In Emily Webb's case, it was not sufficient.

We do not know what determines the "complete set" for each victim. We do not know why some people are targeted and others are not. We do not know where the erased individuals go, if they go anywhere at all.

Mr. Webb has asked us to help him find his sister. We cannot search for someone who never existed. We can only document his testimony and hope that the journals he provided offer some clue to The Collector's nature.

He has also asked us to protect him. He believes he may be next—that The Collector targets families.

We cannot protect against an enemy we cannot see, predict, or even confirm exists. We can only advise him to own nothing irreplaceable, to let no single object define his identity, to become, if necessary, no one at all.

It is poor comfort. But it is all we have.

### MARCUS WEBB
_Final statement._

I've started giving things away.

The photos from my childhood. The books my father gave me. My grandmother's watch. Everything that means something to me, I've handed to friends, to colleagues, to strangers.

I'm trying to become uncollectable.

Some nights I wake up and I can't remember what I gave away or why. I find gaps in my apartment where things used to be. I find lists in my handwriting of objects I don't remember owning.

Maybe The Collector has already started. Maybe I'm already disappearing and I just haven't noticed yet.

Or maybe I'm going crazy. Maybe there was never an Emily. Maybe the journals are something I wrote myself, a delusion so complete that I created twelve years of a sister who never existed.

But I remember her. I remember her voice and her laugh and the way she always stole the olives from my salads. I remember the drawing I made when I was six, four stick figures holding hands: Mom, Dad, Emily, me.

Someone took that drawing from a locked box.

Someone is collecting me piece by piece.

And when they finish, you won't remember reading this.
