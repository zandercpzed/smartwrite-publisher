### MIGUEL SANTOS
_Recovered after twelve days. Interview conducted upon reorientation._

I went in for a flu shot. Standard stuff. Walk in, get a number, wait your turn.

The ticket said 2,847.

The counter said NOW SERVING: 47.

I laughed. Figured it was a software glitch. Found a seat, pulled out my phone to kill time.

That was my first mistake. When I looked up, the room had changed. More people. Different people. The magazines on the table were from months I didn't recognize. And my phone said it had been four hours.

I went to the desk. Asked what was going on, when my number would be called. The receptionist smiled and said I was in the queue, shouldn't be long now, please take a seat.

The counter still said 47.

I tried to leave. That's when I realized I couldn't find the door. There was a wall where the entrance should be. There was a hallway that looped back to the waiting room. There was a fire exit that opened onto more waiting room.

I wasn't alone. There were maybe thirty of us, all holding tickets, all waiting. I tried talking to them. They'd respond, sort of—nod, give one-word answers—then go back to staring at the counter. Like they'd forgotten how to have a conversation. Like they'd been waiting so long they'd forgotten there was anything to do except wait.

By day three, I stopped being hungry. By day five, I stopped being tired. The body just adapts when there's nothing else to do.

By day eight, I started understanding why the others had stopped talking. What is there to say? We're all waiting for the same thing. We're all watching the same counter.

On day twelve, I saw someone get called. Number 48. A woman stood up, walked toward the service window, and passed through a door I hadn't noticed. She didn't come back.

The counter changed to 49.

My number was still 2,847.

I don't remember escaping. I was in the waiting room, and then I was in a parking lot, and it was two weeks later. The Bureau found me lying on the asphalt, clutching my ticket.

The number on the ticket was different every time they looked at it. It's still in my wallet. I can't throw it away. Something in me believes that if I throw it away, I'll lose my place in line.

I know that doesn't make sense. But I've stopped trusting sense.

### MARIANNE COLE
_Never physically entered the building. Affected nonetheless._

I drove my husband to his appointment. Waited in the car.

After three hours, I went in to check on him. The reception desk said they had no record of his appointment. They said they had no record of him at all.

I showed them his ID. They looked confused, asked where I got that, asked why someone else's photo was on his driver's license.

I went back to the car to wait.

That was six years ago.

I'm still waiting. Every day, I drive to that building and sit in the parking lot. I know he's in there. I know his number will be called eventually. I know that when it is, he'll come out that door looking for me.

The building closed four years ago. The county condemned it. But I can see lights on inside sometimes, late at night. I can see shapes moving past the windows.

I know he's in there.

I'll wait as long as it takes.

### DR. EVELYN CROSS
_Bureau Waiting Room Specialist._

The Waiting Room is a manifestation of bureaucratic purgatory—a system designed to process people that has become the entire universe for those trapped within it.

We've recovered 23% of confirmed missing persons from Waiting Room events. The remainder are either still inside or have been "processed" through whatever door awaits at the service window. The seventeen individuals who were processed and subsequently recovered report feeling "different"—lighter, they say, or incomplete. We don't know what the processing involves. We don't know what's removed.

The psychological damage extends beyond those trapped inside. Family members often develop waiting compulsions—an inability to move on, to stop watching for the victim's return. Mrs. Cole isn't unusual. We have fifty-seven documented cases of relatives who've spent years waiting outside condemned buildings for loved ones who may no longer exist.

My recommendation for anyone entering a facility where numbered tickets are dispensed: know your number. The moment you forget your number, you belong to the system. The moment you accept that your number will eventually be called, you've already lost.

If you find yourself holding a ticket you don't remember taking, destroy it immediately. Don't look at it. Don't try to remember the number.

Walk out.

Find the door before you forget it exists.

Your number will never be called. The only way to win is to stop waiting.
