Dominic was my realtor. Good guy, professional, always on time. We'd looked at six properties together before Unit 4B.

The unit had been vacant eight months. Previous tenant "relocated" was all the paperwork said. Good space, decent price, close to work. I was ready to make an offer.

Dominic got there fifteen minutes before me to prep. When I arrived, he was standing in the living room holding a document, smiling. Not his normal smile. Too wide. Too still.

I asked if everything was okay. He said of course, the unit was perfect, I was going to love it here.

Then I noticed the man in the corner.

Brown suit, maybe forty years old, maybe sixty. I couldn't focus on his face—my eyes kept sliding off it. But I could see his hands. Long fingers, too many knuckles, moving like they were conducting music I couldn't hear.

He walked toward me and held out a paper. I saw my name printed at the top. My signature at the bottom—except I'd never seen this document before, never signed anything.

"Your copy," he said.

I asked what it was. He smiled, and the smile kept going, past where a mouth should stop, and he said: "You already signed. Check again."

I ran.

Made it to my car, drove home, called Dominic's phone. Voicemail. Called the real estate office. They said Dominic hadn't come in that day. They said Unit 4B wasn't showing to anyone.

I found the document in my filing cabinet three months later. Lease agreement for Unit 4B, dated years ago, my signature in blue ink. I never signed it. I don't know how it got there.

I've moved twice since then. The document follows me. It's in my files right now, in a folder I didn't create, signed by a hand that looks like mine.

I don't open it anymore. I'm afraid of what it says. I'm afraid I'll understand it.

### DOMINIC FARROW (RECOVERED VOICEMAIL)
_Left for coworker, timestamp 2:31 PM, day of incident._

"Hey, it's Dom. Listen, something weird happened at the Greenview showing. There's a guy here, in the unit, he was waiting when I got here. Says he's the property manager but I've never seen him and he's not in our system and—

"He gave me something. A document. It has my name on it. I don't remember signing but it's my signature, it's definitely my signature, and the terms are—I can't even read the terms, they keep changing when I look at them—

"He says I work here now. He says I've always worked here. He says the building needs a resident manager and I signed the agreement and—

"I need to go. He's asking me to show him something. In the basement. I didn't know there was a basement.

"Call me back, okay? Something's wrong. Something's really—"

### AGENT DELACROIX
_Bureau Property Anomaly Division._

The Landlord has been documented in 34 properties across 12 states. It cannot be anticipated, prevented, or contained. It appears in vacant properties and presents documentation that binds victims to impossible terms.

The documents are masterpieces of legal horror. Rent payable in "years of service." Maintenance responsibility for "all rooms, including those not yet constructed." Occupancy requirements for "perpetuity, renewably renewable." Breach of terms results in "eviction," which we believe is a euphemism for removal from existence.

We've recovered some victims' possessions from affected properties. Personal effects, clothing, vehicles parked outside. The victims themselves are never found. Their names appear in building records as if they'd always been there.

Dominic Farrow's business cards now read "Property Management - Permanent Resident." His realtor's license was automatically cancelled due to "change of primary occupation." His family can't remember what job he had before the property management position he's apparently held for years.

The worst part is that we can't prove he's dead. For all we know, he's still in that building, managing a property that exists in some space we can't access, fulfilling terms of a lease he never agreed to.

The Landlord always smiles. The Landlord is always polite. The Landlord insists you already signed.

And somewhere in your files, there's probably a document with your name on it. Something you don't remember agreeing to.

We recommend: never enter a vacant property alone. If someone presents you with documentation you don't remember signing, do not read it, do not acknowledge it, do not touch it. Exit immediately.

And never, ever say "I'm not interested"—that implies you read the offer. Just walk away. Don't look back.

The Landlord is patient. The property will still be there when you're ready.
