### MARCUS WEBB
_Consultant, survived Whitmore & Associates interview. Safety protocols saved his life._

My sister taught me the buddy system. Before any interview, I'd text her the address, the time, the company name. She'd call me exactly ninety minutes in, pretending to be a family emergency.

Most of the time it was just paranoia. This time it saved my life.

The job posting was perfect. Senior Strategy Consultant, Whitmore & Associates. The salary was thirty percent above market. The role description read like someone had copied my resume and turned it into a wish list. I should have been suspicious, but I wanted it too badly to question it.

Three rounds of interviews with normal people. HR, department head, team leads. Everything checked out. LinkedIn profiles, company website, Glassdoor reviews. Whitmore & Associates was real. The employees were real. The fourteenth floor was real.

The final interviewer was not.

Conference Room 14-C. Nice space, good light, the kind of modern minimalist design that says "we have money but we're not flashy about it." He was already seated when I walked in. Middle-aged, professional, forgettable face. The kind of person you'd pass on the street and never remember.

The interview was flawless. He asked about my experience in ways that showed he'd actually read my background. He connected my past work to future opportunities. He made me feel seen, valued, competent. I remember thinking this was the best interview I'd ever had.

Then my phone rang. My sister.

I excused myself to take the call—family emergency, very sorry, I'll just be a moment. He smiled and said of course, take your time, we're nearly finished anyway.

I stepped into the hallway and noticed two things: the conference room looked bigger from inside than outside, and his hands didn't match. Left hand was pale, long-fingered. Right hand was darker, broader, with a wedding ring that hadn't been there when we shook hands.

I told my sister I loved her and took the stairs.

I found out later that Jennifer Okafor had the same interview in the same room two weeks earlier. She didn't have a buddy system. She took the elevator.

They found her bag but not her.

### RECOVERED NOTES — JENNIFER OKAFOR
_Found in elevator, Whitmore & Associates. Interview incomplete._

Great rapport. Really understood my background. Asked about the Hendricks campaign—how did they know about that? Offered $285K base + equity. Too good. Something wrong with the light in here. His face keeps

### AGENT DELACROIX
_Bureau Employment Anomaly Task Force._

The Interviewer has claimed fourteen confirmed victims over the past decade. Likely more—people vanish during job searches all the time, and not every disappearance gets connected to a phantom interview.

The pattern is consistent: dream job appears, interview process is legitimate until the final round, candidate meets The Interviewer alone, candidate is never seen again. No bodies. No ransom demands. No communication of any kind. They simply cease to exist between the interview room and the ground floor.

We've analyzed security footage from six incidents. In each case, the candidate enters the elevator alone, the elevator descends, the doors open, and the car is empty. Not "the candidate exited elsewhere"—empty. As if they evaporated between floors.

The interview rooms themselves become unstable after an acquisition. Geometry shifts. Measurements don't add up. Conference Room 14-C at Whitmore is currently sealed behind concrete because maintenance workers kept getting lost inside a twelve-by-fifteen space.

The Interviewer's interview technique has been reconstructed from candidate notes and recordings. It's textbook perfect. Active listening, open-ended questions, genuine engagement with the candidate's goals and concerns. If you transcribed it, any HR professional would use it as a training example.

That's what makes it effective. The Interviewer offers something real: recognition. It sees you. It understands your potential. It wants to help you succeed.

And then it takes you somewhere you can never leave.

We recommend the following precautions for any job search: verify postings through multiple independent sources, never attend final interviews alone, establish check-in protocols with trusted contacts, and trust your instincts when an opportunity seems too perfect.

The best opportunities usually are.
