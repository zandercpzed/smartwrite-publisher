# PH-3-341342349-85: THE LOOP

## Forty-Seven Minutes

_Statement from James Chen, recovered from temporal anomaly. Subjective duration: approximately three years._

---

### ITERATION 1

The train arrives at 7:23. I get on. Woman in a blue coat reading a book. Guy with headphones nodding to music. Announcement over the speakers about delays on the Red Line.

I get off at Monroe. Walk to work. Normal morning. Normal day.

---

### ITERATION 2

The train arrives at 7:23. I get on. Same woman, blue coat, same book. But she's on a different page. The guy with headphones is wearing a different shirt.

I think: déjà vu. Weird. Happens to everyone.

I get off at Monroe.

---

### ITERATION 15

I know every face on this train now. I know the woman's name is Rebecca, that she's reading "The Secret History," that she gets off at Jackson. I know the headphones guy is named Marcus and he's listening to a podcast about cryptocurrency.

I've tried talking to them. They respond, they're friendly, but they don't remember me. Every time the loop resets, I'm a stranger again.

I've stopped getting off at Monroe. I ride the whole line, looking for anything different.

Everything is the same. Except the small things. The number of pigeons at each stop. The exact wording of the announcements. Small variations, like the universe can't quite remember how it's supposed to go.

---

### ITERATION 127

I tried not getting on the train. Stayed in bed.

Woke up at 7:23 on the platform.

---

### ITERATION 204

I jumped in front of the train.

Woke up at 7:23 on the platform.

---

### ITERATION 500

The faces are starting to change. Not the people—they're still Rebecca and Marcus and the others. But their faces are subtly wrong. Marcus's eyes are a little too far apart today. Rebecca has too many teeth when she smiles.

They don't notice. They act normal. They always act normal.

---

### ITERATION 1,000

I've started scratching tally marks into my arm. The scratches heal during the reset, but the scars accumulate somehow. I use them to estimate my count. The Bureau analysts who examined me later said I'd been inside for approximately four thousand iterations.

Three years of my life. Subjective time. Forty-seven minutes, objective time.

---

### ITERATION 2,347

Rebecca stopped reading today. She just sat there, staring at her book, not turning pages. When I looked at the cover, the title was different. "The Secret History" was now "The Ending That Never Comes."

I don't remember that book existing.

---

### ITERATION 3,891

Marcus took off his headphones and looked directly at me. He said: "How many times have we done this?"

I couldn't answer. I was too shocked that someone else remembered.

He put his headphones back on. Next iteration, he didn't remember asking.

---

### ITERATION 4,000-SOMETHING

The loop ended.

No warning. I was standing on the platform at 7:23, bracing for another repetition, and the train arrived and I got on and it was 8:10 and then it was 8:11 and time moved forward.

I collapsed on the floor of the train and cried. The other passengers thought I was having a breakdown. They weren't wrong.

---

### NOW

I can't ride trains. I can't experience any moment without waiting for it to repeat. Every morning, I wake up and check the time, check the date, check that yesterday still happened.

Sometimes I see Rebecca. On streets where she shouldn't be. In the grocery store. Walking past my apartment building. Reading a book with no title.

She never looks at me. But I know she sees me.

I don't think I escaped. I think the loop just got bigger. I think it's still happening, but now it includes more time, more space, more people.

I'm still counting. Still scratching marks into my arm.

Still waiting for 7:23 to come around again.

### DR. HELEN CROSS
_Bureau Temporal Anomaly Division._

The Loop is one of our most poorly understood phenomena. We don't know what causes it, what sustains it, or what ends it. James Chen is our longest-duration survivor—three subjective years trapped in a forty-seven-minute cycle.

His account is consistent with other Loop victims: small variations between iterations, gradual degradation of the baseline reality, psychological deterioration that plateaus but never fully stabilizes. The variations are the cruelest element—if every repetition were identical, victims might adapt. But the small changes keep them off-balance, never quite sure what's real, never quite able to predict what comes next.

We don't know why Chen was released. The Loop simply stopped. We don't know if it might start again.

He's right to be worried. The woman he calls "Rebecca" has been photographed near his apartment seventeen times in the past six months. She's never the same woman, but she's always wearing a blue coat, always carrying a book.

The Loop may not be over. It may just be taking its time.
