### SANDRA OKONKWO
_Recovered after nineteen days. Furniture store employee, ironically._

I just wanted a bookshelf. Billy, the classic one, everybody has it. In and out, thirty minutes, that was the plan.

Noticed something wrong about an hour in. I'd passed the same KALLAX display three times. The same arrangement of fake books and decorative baskets, three times, walking in a straight line.

Asked an employee for directions. Young guy, Swedish name tag—Björn or Magnus, something like that. Couldn't tell you what his face looked like. He smiled and said the warehouse was just past the bedroom section.

I walked through bedrooms for another hour. They kept going. Bedroom after bedroom after bedroom, each one slightly different, each one leading to more bedrooms.

That's when I understood I wasn't in a store anymore.

Took me three days to find other customers. There were about a dozen of us, all trapped, all trying to find the exit. We grouped up. Safety in numbers.

The Staff didn't like that.

They'd approach us, all smiles and helpfulness, suggesting we "spread out to browse more effectively." We refused. They got more insistent. By day five, they weren't asking anymore—they were steering us, gentle hands on shoulders, guiding us back toward the displays whenever we tried to move together.

Marcus was the first to break. Day seven, he sat down in a display living room—one of those perfect fake apartments with the fake books and fake plants—and said he was tired. Said maybe the store wasn't so bad. Said at least there was always somewhere to sit.

We left him there. We had to.

I found him two days later. He was arranging throw pillows. He looked happy. He said he worked there now, had worked there for years, couldn't I see his name tag?

He was wearing a yellow shirt.

I found the exit on day nineteen.

It was a maintenance door, tucked behind a bathroom display. I almost missed it—my brain kept sliding past it, like it wasn't supposed to be there. I had to force myself to focus, to walk toward it, to grab the handle.

It opened onto the parking lot. Sunny day, cars everywhere, the real world.

I turned around and the door was gone. Just a wall.

I've never been back. I order everything online now. Furniture, groceries, everything. I can't walk into a retail store without hearing them asking if I need assistance, if I'm finding everything okay, if I'd like to see the showroom.

The Bureau says there are forty-seven people still missing from that store. They've closed the location, but sometimes at night, if you drive past, you can see lights on inside.

They're still in there. Marcus is still in there. Still browsing. Still being helped.

I wonder if he remembers he wasn't always Staff.

I wonder if any of them do.

### AGENT REYES
_Bureau Retail Anomaly Division._

The Infinite IKEA is one of our more contained manifestations—it exists within specific retail locations and cannot spread beyond them. The bad news is that we can't close those locations permanently; the space adapts, repairs itself, calls to customers.

The Staff are the most disturbing element. We believe they're former customers who've been fully integrated into the store's logic. They wear the uniform, they know the inventory, they herd new visitors deeper into the showroom. They don't remember their old lives. As far as they know, they've always worked there.

We've recovered thirty-one people from the New Jersey location over the past six years. Most required significant psychological support—weeks or months inside a space that doesn't end will change anyone. Some never fully readjusted. A few asked to go back.

The Staff are always recruiting. They need people to maintain the displays, to greet the customers, to keep the showroom running. The store wants to be shopped. The store needs to be shopped.

If you enter a furniture store and the showroom seems to continue impossibly, turn around immediately. Do not follow Staff directions. Do not eat or drink anything from the café or marketplace. Do not sit down.

Move against the flow. Mark your path. Find the door.

And never, ever let them give you a name tag.
